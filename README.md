# VQE_Demo
Jupyter notebook for a demo of VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)

This demo was presented at ISCA 2018 in LA ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E947xs9-Mso)), [ATPESC 2018](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/sessions/presentation-quantum-part-2/) in St Charles IL, and [MICRO 2018](https://www.microarch.org/micro51/Program/Workshop/index.html) in Fukuoka, Japan.

Note that the notebook will not run standalone, without the underlying Docker installation. It is uploaded here only for reference.
